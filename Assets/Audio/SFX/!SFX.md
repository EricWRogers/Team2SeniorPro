When importing SFX...
=====================

Make sure of what you want it to be, if it is a fanfare or song type effect (for example `Level_Lose`),
you can choose to leave the settings unchanged (unless you want to change an import setting) when importing.

If the sound should be a legitimate "effect" (bang, jump, button push, etc) please choose the
`Force To Mono` setting and ensure that `Normalize` is also enabled.

With these two settings, Unity will amplify the sound for you so you don't have to make it louder/quieter in an audio editor yourself.
