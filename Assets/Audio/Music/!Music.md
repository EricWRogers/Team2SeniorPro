Note from the programmer:
=========================

Please make the MP3 a readable title, not just the youtube mp3 download full channel name, album, and title.

EX: `Squirrel Simulator Full SoundtrackSquirrel Simulator Soundtrack (Placeholder)`
(actual file name we're using atm btw)

Would be renamed to something like: 
`Main Theme Placeholder` or 
`"Main Theme"`.

Even the name of the original track, 
example: `A Ghost's Pumpkin Soup (Pumpkin Hill) - Sonic Adventure 2 [OST]` 
would become `Pumpkin Hill"` ...

Underscores in place of spaces are not required, but please avoid non letters/numbers when possible (apostrophes, commas, exclamation points, etc)

So that you dont have to type the full thing into the script when calling 

`SoundManager.Instance.PlayMusic(Music Track name");`
